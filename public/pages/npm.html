        <h2>How to use npm:</h2>
        <p>
            Node.js is installed by default with npm
            <br><br>
            To initiate npm in your project run the following command:
            <br>
            <code>npm init</code>
            This will create the package.json file, which is used to organize the repositories you are using.
            <br><br>
            Simply use the npm keyword in front of a repository name ( and evt. setup keywords) and the repository will be installed. Repository library can be found at npmjs.com
            <br><br>
            Example:
            <br>
            <code>npm i {repository name}</code>
            This will install a repository.
            <br><br>
            Alternatively add the repository to your package.json file
        </p>
