            <span class="quote">'Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a
                robust set of features for web and mobile applications. <br>
                With a myriad of HTTP utility methods and middleware at your disposal, creating a robust API is quick and easy.<br>
                Express provides a thin layer of fundamental web application features, without obscuring Node.js features that you know and love.

            <span class="quote">'Express is the most popular Node web framework, and is the underlying library for a
                number of other popular Node web frameworks. It provides mechanisms to:<br>
                - Write handlers for requests with different HTTP verbs at different URL paths (routes).<br>
                - Integrate with "view" rendering engines in order to generate responses by inserting data into templates.<br>
                - Set common web application settings like the port to use for connecting, and the location of templates that are used for rendering the response.<br>
                - Add additional request processing "middleware" at any point within the request handling pipeline.'</span>

        <h2>How to use express:</h2>
        <p>
            First you must add express to your project using npm
            <br>
            <code>npm install express</code>
            Or alternatively add express in your package.json file
            <br><br>
            Then import express into your main javascript file:
            <code>
                const express = require("express"); <br>
                const app = express();
            </code>
            <br><br>
            You are now ready to use all available express functions using the "app" variable. <br>
            in the "Basic Webserver page, some of those functions are demonstrated.
