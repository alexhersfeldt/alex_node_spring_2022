            <span class="quote">'nodemon is a tool that helps develop node.js based applications by automatically restarting
                the node application when file changes in the directory are detected.<br>
                nodemon does not require any additional changes to your code or method of development. nodemon is a replacement wrapper for node.
                To use nodemon, replace the word node on the command line when executing your script.'</span>

        <h2>How to use nodemon:</h2>
        <p>
            Install nodemon using the npm CLI
            <br><br>
            <code>npm install -g nodemon</code>
            This installs nodemon globally on your computer
            <br><br>
            Then use the nodemon keyword in a terminal to run a program with nodemon, just as you would with node.
            <br><br>
            Example:
            <br>
            <code>nodemon app.js</code>
        </p>
